The [OpenAPI specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) is a programming language-agnostic standard for documenting HTTP APIs. This standard is supported in minimal APIs by the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi) package. There are three key aspects to OpenAPI integration in an application:

* Generating information about the endpoints in the app.
* Gathering the information into a format that matches the OpenAPI schema.
* Exposing the generated OpenAPI schema via a visual UI or a serialized file.

The following code is generated by the ASP.NET Core minimal web API template and uses OpenAPI:

[!code-csharp[](~/fundamentals/minimal-apis/9.0-samples/WebMinOpenApi/Program.cs?name=snippet_default&highlight=5,11)]

In the preceding highlighted code:

* [`AddOpenApi`](https://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi/Extensions/OpenApiServiceCollectionExtensions.cs,66158041cba8c238) registers services required for OpenAPI document generation into the app's DI container.
* [`MapOpenApi`](https://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi/Extensions/OpenApiEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs,da6124cfb6e2f8d8) adds an endpoint into the application for viewing the OpenAPI document serialized into JSON.
