# Build a Blazor movie database app (Overview)

<!-- UPDATE 9.0 Activate after release

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

This tutorial explains the basics of building a Blazor Web App with a database, Entity Framework (EF) Core, and user interactivity.

<!-- REVIEWER NOTE

To harden this series for future changes, I'd like to use "part-X"
UID and file naming. This permits me to make significant changes
to article content and only be concerned with titles, descriptions, 
and heading changes ... no renaming of files and no need for article 
redirects. In file lists, the articles appear in reading order.
