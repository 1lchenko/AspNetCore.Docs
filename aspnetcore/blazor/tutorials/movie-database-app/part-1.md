# Build a Blazor movie database app (Part 1 - Create a Blazor Web App)

<!-- UPDATE 9.0 Activate after release

[!INCLUDE[](~/includes/not-latest-version.md)]

-->

This article is the first part of the Blazor movie database app tutorial that teaches you the basics of building an ASP.NET Core Blazor Web App with features to manage a movie database.

This article, the first step of the tutorial series, shows you how to create a Blazor Web App that adopts static server-side rendering (static SSR). Static SSR means that content is rendered on the server and sent to the client for static display. The rendered UI can only receive and post data back to the server for database operations via ordinary HTML form processing. Blazor's built-in event processing support isn't available when adopting static SSR. In the last part of the tutorial series, *interactivity* is adopted, and Blazor's built-in event processing is demonstrated.

At the end of this tutorial, you'll have an interactive Blazor Web App that manages a database of movies.

## Prerequisites

:::zone pivot="vs"

[Visual Studio (latest release)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="vsc"

Latest releases of:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

The Visual Studio Code (VS Code) instructions for ASP.NET Core development in this tutorial use the [.NET CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/), which is part of the .NET SDK.

This tutorial assumes that you have familiarity with VS Code. If you're new to VS Code, see the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs). The videos listed on the [Introductory Videos page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) are designed to give you an overview of VS Code's features.

Confirm that you have the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) installed.

In VS Code:

* Select **New Terminal** from the **Terminal** menu to open the [**Terminal**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).
* Change to the directory using the `cd` command to where you want to create the project folder.
* Use the [`dotnet new` command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) with the [`blazor` project template](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates#blazor) to create a new Blazor Web App project. The [`-o|--output` option](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new#options) passed to the command creates the project in a new folder named "`BlazorWebAppMovies`" at the current terminal directory location.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Name the project `BlazorWebAppMovies`, including matching the capitalization, so the namespaces match for code that you copy from the tutorial to the app as you follow this tutorial.

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorWebAppMovies
  ```

* Use the [`code` command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_command-line) to open the `BlazorWebAppMovies` folder in the current instance of Visual Studio Code:

  ```dotnetcli
  code -r BlazorWebAppMovies
  ```

For more information, see <xref:blazor/tooling?pivots=linux-macos>.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="cli"

Confirm that you have the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) installed.

In a command shell opened to the project's root folder:

* Change to the directory using the `cd` command to where you want to create the project folder.
* Use the [`dotnet new` command](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) with the [`blazor` project template](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates#blazor) to create a new Blazor Web App project. The [`-o|--output` option](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new#options) passed to the command creates the project in a new folder named "`BlazorWebAppMovies`" at the current shell directory location.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Name the project `BlazorWebAppMovies`, including matching the capitalization, so the namespaces match for code that you copy from the tutorial to the app as you follow this tutorial.

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new blazor -o BlazorWebAppMovies
  ```

## Run the app

:::zone pivot="vs"

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> on the keyboard to run the app without the debugger.

Visual Studio displays the following dialog when a project is not yet configured to use SSL:

![This project is configured to use SSL. To avoid SSL warnings in the browser you can choose to trust the self-signed certificate that IIS Express has generated. Would you like to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate?](~/getting-started/_static/trustCertVS22.png)

Select **Yes** if you trust the IIS Express SSL certificate.

The following dialog is displayed:

![Security warning dialog](~/getting-started/_static/cert.png)

Select **Yes** if you agree to trust the development certificate.

Visual Studio:

* Runs the app, which launches the [Kestrel server](xref:fundamentals/servers/kestrel).
* Launches the default browser at `https://localhost:{PORT}`, which displays the app's UI. The `{PORT}` placeholder is the random port assigned to the app when the app is created.

Navigate to the pages of the app to confirm that the app is working normally.

Close the browser window.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="vsc"

For information on trusting the HTTPS certificate for browsers other than Firefox, see the [HTTPS development certificate trust guidance](xref:security/enforcing-ssl#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-windows-and-macos). When using the Firefox browser, see the [Firefox certificate trust guidance](xref:security/enforcing-ssl#trust-the-https-certificate-with-firefox-to-prevent-sec_error_inadequate_key_usage-error).

In VS Code, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> (macOS) to run the app without debugging.

At the **Select debugger** prompt, select **.NET 5+ and .NET Core**.

![Select environment dialog](~/blazor/tutorials/movie-database-app/part-1-app/_static/vsc-select-debugger.png)

The default browser is launched at `https://localhost:{PORT}`, which displays the app's UI. The `{PORT}` placeholder is the random port assigned to the app when the app is created.

Navigate to the pages of the app to confirm that the app is working normally.

Close the browser window.

Stop the app from the **Run** menu by selecting **Stop Debugging** or press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> on the keyboard.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="cli"

For information on trusting the HTTPS certificate for browsers other than Firefox, see the [HTTPS development certificate trust guidance](xref:security/enforcing-ssl#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-windows-and-macos). When using the Firefox browser, see the [Firefox certificate trust guidance](xref:security/enforcing-ssl#trust-the-https-certificate-with-firefox-to-prevent-sec_error_inadequate_key_usage-error) section of that article.

In a command shell opened to the project's root folder, execute the [`dotnet run`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run) command to compile and start the app:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the app's launch settings file (`Properties/launchSettings.json`), the `http` profile precedes the `https` profile. When an app is run with the .NET CLI, the app runs at an HTTP (insecure) endpoint because the first profile found is `http`. The profile order eases the transition of adopting HTTPS for Linux and macOS users. If you prefer to start the app with HTTPS without having to pass the [`-lp https`|`--launch-profile https` option](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run#options) to the `dotnet run` command, simply move the `https` profile above the `http` profile in the file.

The default browser is launched at `https://localhost:{PORT}`, which displays the app's UI. The `{PORT}` placeholder is the random port assigned to the app when the app is created.

Navigate to the pages of the app to confirm that the app is working normally.

Close the browser window.

Stop the app from the **Run** menu by selecting **Stop Debugging** or press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> on the keyboard.

<!-- 
Each new version, change the layout file to use the non-minified CSS. 
See https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/21193
-->

## Examine the project files

The following sections contain an overview of the project's folders and files.

### `Properties` folder

The `Properties` folder holds development environment configuration in the `launchSettings.json` file.

### `wwwroot` folder

The `wwwroot` folder contains static assets, such as images, JavaScript (`.js`), and stylesheet (`.css`) files.

### `Components/Layout` folder

The `Components/Layout` folder contains the following layout components and stylesheets:

* `MainLayout` component (`MainLayout.razor`): The app's main layout component.
* `MainLayout.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's main layout.
* `NavMenu` component (`NavMenu.razor`): Implements sidebar navigation. This component uses several `NavLink` components to render navigation links to other Razor components.
* `NavMenu.razor.css`: Stylesheet for the app's navigation menu.

### `Components` and `Components/Pages` folder

These folders contain *Razor components*, often referred to as "components," and supporting files. A component is a self-contained portion of user interface (UI) with processing logic to enable dynamic behavior. Components can be nested, reused, shared among projects, and used in MVC and Razor Pages apps.

Components are implemented using a combination of C# and HTML markup in [Razor](xref:mvc/views/razor) component files with the `.razor` file extension.

Typically, components that are nested within other components and not directly reachable ("routable") at a URL are placed in the `Components` folder. Components that are routable via a URL are usually placed in the `Components/Pages` folder.

Although the name "Razor components" shares some naming with other ASP.NET Core content-rendering technologies, Razor components must be distinguished from *Razor views*, which are [Razor-based](xref:mvc/views/razor) markup pages for MVC apps, and *View components*, which are for rendering chunks of content rather than whole responses in Razor Pages and MVC apps.

### `_Imports.razor` file

The `_Imports` file (`_Imports.razor`) includes common *Razor directives* to include in the app's components (`.razor`). Razor directives are reserved keywords prefixed with `@` that appear in Razor markup and change the way component markup or component elements are parsed or function.

### `App.razor` file

The `App` component (`App.razor`) is the root component of the app with HTML `<head>` markup, the `Routes` component, and the Blazor script (`<script>` tag for `blazor.web.js`). The root component is the first component that the app loads.

### `Routes.razor` file

The `Routes` component (`Routes.razor`) sets up routing for the app.

### `appsettings.json` file

The `appsettings.json` file contains configuration data, such as connection strings.

### `Program.cs` file

The `Program.cs` file contains code to create the app and configure the request processing pipeline of the app.

A <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder> creates the app with preconfigured defaults:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

Razor component services are added to the app to enable Razor components to render and execute code:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRazorComponents();
```

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication> (held by the `app` variable in the following code) is built:

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
```

Next, the HTTP request pipeline is configured.

In the development environment:

* Exception Handler Middleware (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.ExceptionHandlerExtensions.UseExceptionHandler%2A>) processes errors and displays a developer exception page during development app runs.
* [HTTP Strict Transport Security Protocol (HSTS) Middleware](xref:security/enforcing-ssl#http-strict-transport-security-protocol-hsts) (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%2A>) processes [HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html).

```csharp
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error", createScopeForErrors: true);
    app.UseHsts();
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't run a production app in development mode because the developer exception page can leak sensitive information.

HTTPS Redirection Middleware (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A>) enforces the HTTPS protocol by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS:

```csharp
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
```

Static File Middleware (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileExtensions.UseStaticFiles%2A>) serves static files, such as images, scripts, and stylesheets from the `wwwroot` folder:

```csharp
app.UseStaticFiles();
```

Antiforgery Middleware (<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.AntiforgeryApplicationBuilderExtensions.UseAntiforgery%2A>) enforces antiforgery protection during form processing:

```csharp
app.UseAntiforgery();
```

<xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.RazorComponentsEndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.MapRazorComponents%2A> maps components defined in the root `App` component to the given .NET assembly and renders routable components:

```csharp
app.MapRazorComponents<App>();
```

The app is run by calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%2A> on the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication> (`app`):

```csharp
app.Run();
```
